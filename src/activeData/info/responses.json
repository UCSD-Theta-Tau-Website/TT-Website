    "Career": "As an aspiring Project Manager, I hope to diversify my portfolio and manage projects from public to private sectors, from large-scale scope to small-scale intricacies. My inspiration for project management stems from my passion to work with people while maintaining both my technical and business expertise. Being able to communicate effectively and empower stakeholder engagement is my day-to-day job and Theta Tau has helped me gain more confidence in doing so.",
    "TT": "Theta Tau has provided me the social environment necessary to develop my soft skills. Coming in as an engineer, it was a skillset that I lacked and needed guidance. In addition to the professional development, Theta Tau has supported my ambitions to grow in my field of expertise and become more confident in working with stakeholders. Theta Tau was both a professional organization but also a second family where I can be myself around.",

    "Interests": "I really enjoy large music festivals and am a big yelper myself, so I find most of my weekends to be discovering new options on Yelp or reviewed by food critics.",

    "Major": "Electrical Engineering",
    "Graduation": 2022,
    "Career": "I'm very grateful to say that my current position as a Technical Program Manager at Microsoft is a role I've dreamed of having for years. After several hackathons and software engineering internships, I realized that even though I was terrible at coding, I was still extremely passionate about developing products that improve the community. Today at Microsoft, I work on products that use identity verification to improve the security of digital environments. In the coming years, I hope to pursue an MBA or a graduate degree in engineering to further my knowledge and career as a PM.",
    "TT": "Thanks to the extensive alumni network and the actives that I am proud to say are some of my closest friends, Theta Tau has helped me grow immensely as an individual and professional. Aside from learning how to write the perfect email and give a firm handshake, I learned the importance of holding myself to a high standard while giving myself grace when I made mistakes. I also learned how to be an effective leader and how to bounce back from burnout. Above all, the overwhelming support from this community even after graduating is something I’m most grateful for.",
    "Favorite Memory": "There are too many memories that come to mind, but one of my favorites will always be when some of my pbros and I received a noise complaint while doing karaoke in our apartment. We were summer interns living in Seattle with nothing better to do than blast throwback songs from our speaker and sing. It wasn’t a crazy night, but it goes to show that even the smallest moments were special. ",
    "Interests": "Lately, I’ve been spending most of my free time bouldering, gardening, doing yoga, and traveling. I also enjoy hiking, cooking, skiing, and playing board games. I also love live music and can be found attending events ranging from music festivals to Broadway musicals.",

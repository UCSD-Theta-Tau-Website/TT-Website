# UCSD Theta Tau Chapter Website Redesign
Welcome to the README file of the UCSD Theta Tau Chapter Website Redesign repository. This project aims to address the issues with the [original website](https://github.com/UCSDTT/ucsdtt-website), which was created in 2018. Over time, the website's layout and content have become outdated, resulting in user dissatisfaction and performance concerns. Our goal with this new website redesign is to improve the overall user experience and create a visually appealing, modern, and user-friendly website.

## Project Overview
The UCSD Theta Tau Chapter Website Redesign project focuses on revamping the existing website to meet current web design standards and implement features requested by users. This repository serves as the central hub for the project's source code and design processes.

## Key Objectives
- Modern Web Design: We recognize the need to update the website's visual aesthetics and ensure it aligns with contemporary design principles and trends.

- Improved User Experience: By addressing the issues raised by users, we aim to enhance the website's usability, navigation, and overall user satisfaction.

- Performance Optimization: We understand the importance of speed and responsiveness. Our redesign will incorporate optimizations to deliver a faster and smoother browsing experience.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

src: Contains the source code for the new website design and any related assets.

design: Contains design-related materials, including design decisions, prototypes, and iterations.
